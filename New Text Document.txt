You too, no probs.
Would you provide your requirement?
more details
Sure, So I have this IOS app VPN
it currently failed the Apple review process for few reasons
User Avatar
Main one was primarily due to In App Purchases
What can I do for you?
So I'm not a developer
but i read and understood what i needed to add to the app
so I have designed the windows
User Avatar
I just need someone to implement the logic
OK
Would you share your project?
So your requirement is that I should implement IAP in your app.
right?
No IAP is there
I think its easier for me if i share u app
Can i ?
User Avatar
Do you have testflight?
yes
should I send you my email?
User Avatar
okay
howard_weaver86@hotmail.com
Hmm it doesn't allow me to send you invite
User Avatar
i can share with you the project
Can you share source?
via google driver or wetransfer
its not too big
User Avatar
OK
Just sec
Let me check it now
User Avatar
cool
Give me few min
first page
right?
yeah well it should sort of load this page first for few seconds on first install
User Avatar
then you should see the windows you are on
yes
just sec
so should I fix it?
increase seconds for splash screen?
Yea i think that needs to be adjusted it seems to happen to fast or not at all
but this should only be shown on first install
if that make sense
But the changes I would like you to quote me on are
When the user installs the app
they see the splash screen
then they should see this window
User Avatar
Does that make sense?
got it
Cool
then the next window
should be this
There should be a X in the top right corner
User Avatar
for user to close this window down
got it
Cool
and if the user closes this down
they will return to the main window with the connect button
if they press connect
it should show that
User Avatar
window to subscribe
got it
User Avatar
one they have purchased the subscription the window should disappear and they should be able to use the app
got it
understood
Cool and I would like the app to support Ipad if possible
User Avatar
how much would these changes cost and can you doit?
Ok, I can do it.
And 250
$
including ipad responsibility
User Avatar
Okay and ETA?
